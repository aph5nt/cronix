Cronix
======================

# What is Cronix?
Cronix is an open source job scheduling library. It can be easily used to create window services or be embedded in your windows / console applications. Cronix supports compiled and external job registration.  
The external ones are written in a F# start-up script as a template. They can be changed whenever you want - no recompilation of your application will be required. Job scheduling  is based on CRON expressions. 
Cronix works well with C# and F# applications.
